Good job on implementing the interactive options although they are not all integrated.
7.5/10
-1 the interaction to highlight the US map is buggy, sometimes requiring two clicks, sometimes one
-1.5 the tool tip on hover feature on the line chart does not work completely. 
It gets cut off if I look for information from July - October 
(and does not show anything for the orange/green lines after october).
