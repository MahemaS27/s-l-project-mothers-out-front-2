10/10
Good job so far! On track for completion. 
a) Could you enable deselcting a state when the user clicks outside of a map? 
Right now, the user needs to click on to the map to de-select again. Something to think about!
b) You could also have a tool-tip appear on hover over the line charts. Would be a neat addition!
c) Label the axes.

Extremely intuitive interaction! Good job once again.
